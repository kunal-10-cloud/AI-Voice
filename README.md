Voice Agent – Engineering Assignment 1

A production-ready, low-latency, real-time voice assistant capable of natural, interruptible conversations with multiple concurrent users. The system is built with a strong focus on latency, robustness, observability, and engineering judgment, closely mirroring real-world voice AI systems.

⸻

 Project Overview

This project implements a cascaded, streaming voice pipeline that allows users to talk to an AI agent as naturally as they would to a human. The agent supports:
	•	Real-time speech recognition
	•	Natural turn-taking and barge-in (interruptions)
	•	Dynamic context updates during an active conversation
	•	Real-time web search for current information
	•	Session-scoped conversation memory
	•	Multi-user concurrent sessions
	•	End-to-end observability with detailed metrics
	•	Provider fallback for resilience

The system is designed to degrade gracefully, remain responsive under load, and expose internal performance characteristics clearly.

Architecture Overview

Backend (Node.js)
	•	WebSocket-based server for low-latency, bidirectional audio and control messages
	•	Session Manager to isolate users and prevent context bleed
	•	State-machine driven turn detection (speech_start → speech_end)
	•	Streaming integrations for STT and TTS
	•	LLM orchestration layer with tool invocation and fallback logic

Frontend (React)
	•	Real-time microphone capture
	•	Visual agent avatar with speaking/listening/thinking states
	•	Live transcripts for both user and assistant
	•	Left-hand metrics sidebar for per-turn observability

⸻

🔊 Custom Audio Processing

Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
	•	Implemented using energy-based heuristics on raw PCM audio
	•	Converts Int16 PCM → Float32 for accurate signal processing
	•	Tuned thresholds to balance responsiveness and false positives

Turn Detection
	•	Driven by a VAD-gated state machine
	•	Includes a grace period to avoid cutting off trailing phonemes
	•	Prevents transcript fragmentation and improves STT accuracy

⸻

🗣️ Speech-to-Text (STT)
	•	Primary Provider: Deepgram (Streaming WebSocket)
	•	Always-on STT connection to eliminate startup latency
	•	Interim transcripts are replaced, final transcripts are appended
	•	Downstream logic runs only on final transcripts

STT Stability Improvements
	•	Turn-final buffering (no partial-word commits)
	•	Confidence-based validation
	•	Clarification prompts on ambiguous or low-confidence transcripts

STT Fallback
	•	Fallback Provider: AssemblyAI (HTTP, final transcript only)
	•	Triggered on connection failure, timeout, or provider errors

⸻

LLM Processing
	•	Primary Provider: Groq (fast inference)
	•	Secondary Provider: Groq (separate API key for fallback simulation)

Features
	•	Session-scoped conversation memory (bounded sliding window)
	•	Tool-based reasoning for web search
	•	Prompting optimized for spoken, human-like responses (not bullet points)
	•	Numerical and temperature responses formatted for natural speech

LLM Fallback
	•	Automatic fallback on rate limits, timeouts, or network failures
	•	Transparent to the user
	•	Logged and surfaced in metrics

⸻

 Web Search Integration
	•	Provider: Tavily Search API
	•	Intent-gated search (only triggers for time-sensitive / external queries)
	•	Search results are:
	•	Injected ephemerally into the prompt
	•	Never stored in long-term conversation memory
	•	Sources are cited in responses

⸻

Text-to-Speech (TTS)
	•	Primary Provider: Deepgram TTS (streaming)
	•	Audio streamed in browser-compatible format
	•	Frontend uses a dedicated playback AudioContext

Barge-In Support
	•	User can interrupt the assistant mid-speech
	•	TTS stream is immediately cancelled
	•	Playback buffer cleared
	•	New user speech is captured without delay

TTS Fallback
	•	Secondary Provider: Cartesia (HTTP synthesis)
	•	Triggered if streaming TTS fails to start or stalls

⸻

 Real-Time Context Updates
	•	Context can be injected into an active session via WebSocket
	•	Used for:
	•	Changing assistant persona
	•	Applying admin instructions
	•	Context updates:
	•	Are session-scoped
	•	Do not pollute conversation memory
	•	Apply immediately to subsequent responses

⸻

 Multi-User Architecture
	•	Each WebSocket connection maps to an isolated session
	•	No shared mutable state between sessions
	•	Designed to scale horizontally

Scalability Notes
	•	10–100 concurrent users: Single Node.js instance
	•	1000+ users: Horizontal scaling with:
	•	Stateless WebSocket gateways
	•	External session store (e.g., Redis)
	•	Provider-side scaling for STT/LLM/TTS

⸻

 Observability & Metrics Dashboard

For every conversation turn, the system records:
	•	VAD detection timestamps
	•	STT latency
	•	LLM latency (including TTFT)
	•	TTS latency
	•	End-to-end turn latency
	•	Search triggered / skipped
	•	Provider fallback indicators

Metrics are displayed live in the UI sidebar and logged structurally.

⸻

 Structured Logging
	•	JSON logs with correlation IDs
	•	Each log includes:
	•	sessionId
	•	turnId
	•	pipeline stage
	•	timestamp

This allows tracing a single user utterance end-to-end across the system.

⸻

 Conversation Memory
	•	Session-scoped, bounded memory
	•	Last N messages sent to the LLM
	•	Prevents token explosion while preserving context

Future Extensions
	•	Redis-backed persistence
	•	Long-term summarization

⸻

 Testing & Verification
	•	Manual testing with multiple concurrent browser tabs
	•	Admin scripts for:
	•	Live context injection
	•	Session targeting
	•	Simulated provider failures to verify fallback logic

⚖️ Tradeoffs, Iterations & Design Decisions

This project went through multiple iterations while solving real, production-style problems. Below is a transparent account of what didn’t work initially, why changes were made, and the final tradeoffs.

1. STT Stability vs Latency

Initial approach:
	•	Triggered STT transcription aggressively on short silences
	•	Processed partial transcripts immediately

Problems encountered:
	•	Broken words (e.g., “Pun” instead of “Pune”)
	•	Truncated entities and phonemes
	•	Over-reliance on transcript normalization hacks

Final decision:
	•	Move to turn-final transcription only
	•	Introduce a grace period after silence detection
	•	Always-on STT socket to avoid startup delays

Tradeoff:
	•	Slightly higher end-of-turn latency
	•	Significantly higher transcript accuracy and naturalness

⸻

2. WAV / MP3 Streaming vs Raw PCM Playback

Initial approach:
	•	Stream raw PCM (Linear16) audio
	•	Manually convert Int16 → Float32 → AudioBuffer in frontend

Problems encountered:
	•	Skipped words
	•	Partial audio playback
	•	Decode failures due to missing headers

Final decision:
	•	Streaming WAV from TTS provider
	•	Decoding each chunk individually in the browser

Tradeoff:
	•	More frontend audio logic
	•	Deterministic, glitch-free playback with no skipped speech

⸻

3. Tool-Based LLM Search vs Prompt-Based Intent Gating

Initial approach:
	•	Native LLM tool-calling for web search

Problems encountered:
	•	Tool call failures
	•	Over-triggering on generic queries
	•	Poor debuggability

Final decision:
	•	Explicit intent-gating logic
	•	Two-step LLM flow: decision → grounded response

Tradeoff:
	•	Slightly more orchestration code
	•	Full control, predictability, and clean logs

⸻

4. Barge-In Complexity vs System Stability

Initial approach:
	•	Attempted to handle barge-in and audio correctness together

Problems encountered:
	•	Race conditions
	•	Inconsistent TTS cancellation
	•	Unreliable UX

Final decision:
	•	First stabilize audio correctness
	•	Re-introduce barge-in with:
	•	request IDs
	•	atomic TTS cancellation
	•	buffer clearing

Tradeoff:
	•	Longer implementation time
	•	Clean, reliable interruption behavior

⸻

5. Provider Choice & Fallback Strategy

Initial approach:
	•	Single provider per capability

Problems encountered:
	•	Rate limits during barge-in
	•	Hard failures blocking the pipeline

Final decision:
	•	Explicit fallback layers for STT, LLM, and TTS
	•	Secondary Groq key used to simulate provider isolation

Tradeoff:
	•	Slightly more configuration
	•	High resilience and production realism

⸻

6. What Was Deferred Intentionally
	•	Heavy DSP-based noise suppression
	•	Persistent long-term memory
	•	Authentication & access control

These were deferred to keep the focus on core voice interaction quality, latency, and robustness.

This iterative process reflects real-world engineering tradeoffs rather than idealized designs.

⸻

 Future Work
	•	Advanced noise suppression
	•	Semantic caching for repeated queries
	•	Full deployment with autoscaling
